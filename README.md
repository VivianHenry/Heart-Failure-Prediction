<h1>Heart Failure Prediction</h1>

Aim: To develop a machine learning model that can predict the occurence of heart failure, given certain input data.

This project acts as a blueprint approach to any classification problem. While the specifics are dependent on the nature of the problem, the general approach can be outlined as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Select data.</li>
  <li>Preprocess the data.</li>
  <li>Train, test, modify, and compare various machine learning models.</li>
  <li>Select a model.</li>
</ol>

As an additional step, a pipeline was created with the chosen model in order to simplify the preprocessing and modeling code.

This project was created on a Jupyter notebook.
